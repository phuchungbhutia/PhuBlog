# How to Use Git - A Beginner's Guide

Git is a powerful distributed version control system widely used for managing source code and collaborating on projects. Whether you're a developer, designer, or writer, Git helps you track changes, work with others, and maintain a history of your work.

This guide will walk you through the essentials of using Git from installation to basic workflows.

## What is Git?

Git is a tool to track changes in files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed, meaning every user has a full copy of the repository locally.

## Installing Git

### On Windows

- Download the installer from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Run the installer and follow the prompts (the default options work fine)
- Open **Git Bash** to use the Git command line

### On macOS

- Use Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```

```
* Or download from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

### On Linux

* Use your package manager, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install git
```

## Basic Git Workflow

### 1. Setup your identity

Before committing changes, set your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### 2. Initialize a repository

In your project folder, run:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a `.git` folder and starts tracking changes.

### 3. Check the status

See which files are untracked, modified, or staged:

```bash
git status
```

### 4. Stage files for commit

Add files to the staging area:

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Or add all changed files:

```bash
git add .
```

### 5. Commit changes

Save your staged changes with a meaningful message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add initial project files"
```

### 6. View commit history

See your projectâ€™s history:

```bash
git log
```

## Working with Remote Repositories

### Clone an existing repo

Copy a remote repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Add a remote repo

If you created your repo locally and want to link to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Push your commits

Upload your commits to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Pull updates

Fetch and merge changes from the remote:

```bash
git pull
```

---

## Branching and Merging

Branches let you develop features or fixes separately.

### Create a branch

```bash
git branch feature-xyz
```

### Switch to branch

```bash
git checkout feature-xyz
```

### Merge branch into main

Switch to main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Then merge:

```bash
git merge feature-xyz
```

## Tips for Using Git Effectively

* Commit often with clear messages
* Use branches for each feature or fix
* Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
* Use `.gitignore` to exclude files like logs or configs
* Explore GUIs like GitHub Desktop or SourceTree if you prefer a visual interface
