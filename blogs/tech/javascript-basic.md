# JavaScript Basics - A Beginner's Guide

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages used for web development. It allows you to create interactive websites, build server-side applications, and much more. This guide will introduce you to the core concepts of JavaScript so you can start coding with confidence.

---

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser but can also run on servers using environments like Node.js.

---

## Setting Up Your Environment

To write and run JavaScript, you only need a web browser and a text editor.

- Open your browser’s Developer Console (usually by pressing F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab).
- Alternatively, you can install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run JavaScript on your computer’s command line.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables store data values. Use the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare them.

```javascript
let name = "PhuBlog";
const pi = 3.14159;
var age = 25;
```

### Common Data Types

* **String:** Text data, e.g., `"Hello"`
* **Number:** Integers and decimals, e.g., `10`, `3.14`
* **Boolean:** `true` or `false`
* **Null:** Represents no value
* **Undefined:** A variable declared but not assigned
* **Object:** Collections of key-value pairs
* **Array:** Ordered list of values

---

## Operators and Expressions

JavaScript supports arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators:

```javascript
let x = 5 + 3;    // 8
let y = x * 2;    // 16
let isAdult = age >= 18;  // true or false
let isAllowed = (age >= 18) && (hasPermission === true);
```

---

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a task.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("PhuBlog")); // Output: Hello, PhuBlog!
```

Functions can also be written as arrow functions:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(3, 4)); // 7
```

---

## Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to execute code conditionally or repeatedly.

### Conditional Statements

```javascript
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

### Loops

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

You can also use `while` loops:

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

---

## Objects and Arrays

### Objects

Objects store data in key-value pairs.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "PhuBlog",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Hi, I am PhuBlog
```

### Arrays

Arrays hold ordered lists of items.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[1]); // Banana
```

## JavaScript Best Practices

* Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` to avoid scope issues.
* Write meaningful variable and function names.
* Keep functions small and focused.
* Comment your code for clarity.
* Use strict mode by adding `"use strict";` at the top of your script.

---

## Where to Go Next?

* Learn about **DOM Manipulation** to interact with web pages.
* Explore **Events** to make pages respond to user actions.
* Study **Asynchronous JavaScript** including Promises and async/await.
* Try building small projects like a to-do list or calculator.
